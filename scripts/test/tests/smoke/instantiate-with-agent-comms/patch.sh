# Smoke test: instantiate.sh with --features=agent-comms.
#
# Verifies the --features= integration with our agent-comms feature
# end-to-end: a fresh template gets bootstrapped AND our feature gets
# installed in one shot via the same path a real user would take.
#
# Because the upstream template doesn't yet ship features/agent-comms/
# (we haven't PR'd it yet, per the Path-B Build-First strategy), we
# clone the template and INJECT our local features/agent-comms/ into
# the cloned template's features/ directory before running
# instantiate.sh. That lets the test exercise the real instantiate.sh
# --features= integration against the in-development feature.
#
# Inputs:  SANDBOX env var. lib/template.sh's clone_template.
# Effects: $SANDBOX/template-comms/ contains a derivative bootstrapped
#          with --agent=none --features=agent-comms.
