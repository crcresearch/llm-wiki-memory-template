# The contrast that proves the strip: the dev-only rule ships in the template
# (precondition) and .claude/ + .claude/commands/ survive the claude-code
# overlay, but the dev-only rule is gone afterwards while a sibling
# consumer-facing rule is left untouched. Neutralizing the strip flips the
# "stripped" assertion red; regressing to a whole-directory rm -rf flips the
# "sibling survives" assertion red.
