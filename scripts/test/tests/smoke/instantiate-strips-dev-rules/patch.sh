# Smoke test: instantiate.sh strips the template-development-only .claude/rules/.
#
# .claude/rules/ ships guidance for contributors working ON the template
# (e.g. observe-the-failure.md), not behaviour a derived project needs.
# instantiate.sh removes that directory during real instantiation so it does
# not propagate. This runs a real --agent=claude-code instantiation (which
# otherwise KEEPS .claude/ for commands/skills), so the strip is observable
# in isolation: .claude/ survives, .claude/rules/ specifically does not.
#
# Inputs:  SANDBOX env var. lib/template.sh's clone_template.
# Effects: $SANDBOX/template-dev-rules/ contains a derivative.
#          $SANDBOX/dev-rules-was-present is created iff the cloned template
#          shipped .claude/rules/ BEFORE instantiation, so the "absent after"
#          assertion is not vacuous (it must have been present to be stripped).
#
# Idempotent.
