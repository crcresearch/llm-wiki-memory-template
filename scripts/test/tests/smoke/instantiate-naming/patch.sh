# Smoke test: instantiate derives the project name from the origin remote,
# not the clone-directory basename (F1, chunk 03).
#
# Stages a template clone in a directory deliberately named 'clonedir', points
# its origin at .../widget.git, and runs instantiate.sh --agent=none. The
# generated wiki and namespaced files must use 'widget' (from origin), proving
# instantiate resolves the name once via lw_name_from_origin and hands it to
# init-wiki.sh through --repo-name.
#
# Inputs:  SANDBOX env var. lib/template.sh's clone_template.
# Effects: $SANDBOX/instantiate-naming/clonedir bootstrapped with origin=widget.
#
# Hermetic after clone: --agent=none plus local wiki init contact no network;
# the origin remote is only parsed for its name, never fetched.
