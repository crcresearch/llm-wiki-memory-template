# Smoke test: instantiate with --agent=none.
#
# Regression coverage for issue #9: instantiate.sh tripped `set -u` on
# bash 3.2 (macOS default) when INIT_AGENT_ARGS expanded empty for
# --agent=none, killing the bootstrap before init-wiki.sh could run.
#
# This test exercises the no-overlay path end-to-end so the bug cannot
# return silently. Runs against the macOS matrix where bash 3.2 actually
# reproduces the original failure.
#
# Inputs:  SANDBOX env var. lib/template.sh's clone_template.
# Effects: $SANDBOX/template-none/ contains a derivative bootstrapped
#          without any agent overlay.
#
# Idempotent.
