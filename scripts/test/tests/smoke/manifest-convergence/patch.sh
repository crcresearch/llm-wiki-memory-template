# Patch: stage TWO sandboxes that ought to converge on the same on-disk
# file set if scripts/lib/template-manifest.sh is the single source of
# truth shared by instantiate, adopt, and update-from-template.
#
# Sandbox A (instantiate):
#   - clone_template into $STAGE/A
#   - run instantiate.sh "Conv A" --agent=none against it
#   - result P1: the file tree of A after bootstrap
#
# Sandbox B (adopt):
#   - virgin git repo at $STAGE/B
#   - run adopt.sh --target=B --apply --agent=claude-code
#   - result P2: the file tree of B after adopt
#
# Why --agent=none for A and --agent=claude-code for B? The convergence
# we are testing is on TEMPLATE_SHARED_INFRA: the set of files that BOTH
# code paths must produce regardless of overlay. instantiate --agent=none
# stops at SHARED; adopt --agent=claude-code produces SHARED + the
# claude overlay. The assertions intersect on SHARED.
#
# Note on update-from-template: a fuller convergence test would also
# stage Sandbox C running adopt then update. It is deferred because
# update-from-template requires a clonable remote (network or a bare
# mirror) and the hermetic harness has no good way to stage one without
# adding fragile machinery. The adopt-vs-instantiate comparison alone is
# enough to prove the manifest is canonical: update reuses the same
# assembler in detection mode and the unit fixture (scripts/test/tests/
# unit/manifest-shape) already verifies the assembler's contract.
